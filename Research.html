            <h3>Al-Jazeera</h3>
            Al Jazeera pioneered a new paradigm for in-depth journalism that was relevant

            news agenda.

            <h3>The Guardian</h3>
            The Guardian has historically been praised for its investigative journalism,
            its dispassionate discussion of issues, its literary and artistic coverage
            and criticism, and its foreign correspondence. The Guardianâ€™s editorial
            stance is considered less conservative than that of The Daily Telegraph and
            The Times, its main London competitors, but its reporting is also marked by
            its independence.
